# genpassgen

The generator of password generators.


## Usage

Please see <https://johnlin.tw/genpassgen>.


## Why?

Online password generators have the following issues:

1. You are not sure how the passwords are generated.
1. You are not sure whether the generated passwords are not leaked or logged somewhere.

Existing open-sourced password generators have the following issues:

1. You have to install it.
1. You have to learn how to use it.

`genpassgen` is good because:

1. You are in control with how the passwords are generated.
1. You are sure that the generated passwords are not leaked or logged anywhere.
1. You don't have to install anything.
1. Yeah, you still need to learn how to use it. But IMHO, it's easier than any existing open-sourced password generator.
